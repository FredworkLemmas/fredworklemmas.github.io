![](images/yellow_flower_weed_in_front_of_shed_door.jpg)

The book club I'm a part of is finishing up AI Engineering and we're on to the
next book, which is TBD at this point.

Here are some books I'm putting forward as potential candidates for the next
book:

While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of colour graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book.
