I just released [Invocate](https://pypi.org/project/invocate/) which is a
packaged-up version of a wrapper I wrote a while ago to make namespacing with
Invoke tasks a bit easier to work with.

It's a huge improvement over what
I've been doing, which is dragging around a collection of aging python code outside
of a proper package.

It also includes some (breaking) changes that I've been wanting to make for a
while that will make it easier and more intuitive.

And there are docs!
